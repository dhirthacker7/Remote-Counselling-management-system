# Remote-Counselling-management-system

In the current rapid paced society, mental well being is something that is not valued as much as it should be. The hustle and bustle of modern life has contributed to a significant rise in mental health issues which has in turn established the need for better mental healthcare/counselling systems. 


Mental trauma is a common issue faced by people irrespective of their age and is relatable to everyone. Off late, the importance of mental well-being is being significantly recognized. Unaddressed mental trauma leads to severe depression and also suicidal thoughts. Many people consider not going to therapy because they can’t face discussing their issues in person. In that case, a remote counselling system would be of huge help.


OBJECTIVES:
-> This system can enable us to provide support for better mental health.

-> Offers help to cope up with anything and everything: Issues with family, education, mental trauma, work pressure, depression, etc.

-> Helps keep self-confidence stable. Online sessions can help build positivity and confidence among people.

-> Virtual counselling can help people in rehabilitation from relapsing.

-> Helps save time, money and also it can help to maintain record of each session.



Purpose of an online counseling system is as follows:

-> People tend to keep a low profile when they are going through a difficult phase. In that case, counselling is an aspect that can help them with what they are going through,

-> Online counselling is more flexible than in person sessions and it also provides immediate attention in case of emergency. 

-> Online counselling is cost efficient and saves travel time. Both parties involved, do not need to spend time/money on travelling. 

-> The sessions can be conducted in a convenient way, so people don’t have to change their routines for in-person sessions. Online sessions can streamline the appointment process and can also help with rescheduling and other services.
