# Remote-Counselling-management-system

In the current rapid paced society, mental well being is something that is not valued as much as it should be. The hustle and bustle of modern life has contributed to a significant rise in mental health issues which has in turn established the need for better mental healthcare/counselling systems. 


Mental trauma is a common issue faced by people irrespective of their age and is relatable to everyone. Off late, the importance of mental well-being is being significantly recognized. Unaddressed mental trauma leads to severe depression and also suicidal thoughts. Many people consider not going to therapy because they can’t face discussing their issues in person. In that case, a remote counselling system would be of huge help.
